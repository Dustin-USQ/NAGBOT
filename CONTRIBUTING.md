## How to contribute to Nagbot

### Coding Standards

1. If you are responsible for a function then you don't need to use git - you just need to be responsible for the file that your function resides in, i.e: qanda.py. 
2. Dustin and Hilton will update the official github repo with your code
3. Your function should **not** have a `if __name__ == "__main__"` section as this is handled by the main program. Functions accept an argument (either a simple data type such as a string or a more complex type like an object or list) and return data.
4. Dustin and Hilton will use the testing and other branches to manage changes and test the code.

#### Security

Please don't put API keys or credentials into source control - it is a security risk and could get our API key disabled 
which will make troubleshooting our app difficult.


#### Where to get help

If you need help or don't understand please ask in our slack channel. www.git-scm.org has a great tutorial on git if you 
are unfamiliar with git branching and merging.
